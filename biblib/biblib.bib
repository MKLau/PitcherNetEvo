Take-Home: Species richness is tightly linked to trophic diversity and ecosystem function
Notes:
- Possible autocatalytic loop from the trophic cascade to decomposers and back.
- Four species are evolutionarily linked to the pithcer plant. 
- What's the deal with the yeast? They're used to construct the food webs but they are not included in the food web model.

- pollination syndromes are pair-wise specializations, but generalization has been shown to be more common
- evaluated the departure of the observed interaction network structure from that expected by syndromes, modular structure, module relation to syndromes and the robustness of syndromes
- Findings:
- syndromes predicted 69% of the interactions
- Greater modularity than expected by chance
- modules were associated with pollination syndromes
- plant phylogeny did not account for significant amount of variation in interactions
- phylogenetic signal only significant when flies were removed, probably because fly interactions are extremely labile
- Concluded: 
- Support the concept of pollination syndromes
- Accuracy of pollination syndromes was predicted by ornithophily and melittophily

- in low productivity ecosystems, abiotic factors have been thought to drive ecological processes
- precip had a stronger effect under canopies than in open due to lowered evapotranspiration
- density and precipitation indirectly affect perenniel canopy cover
- mortality driven by competition, but not by precipitation
- model explained substantial variation
- simulation model showed positive feedback of density on cover produces unique temporal abudance patterns through buggering changes in abudnaces and decoupling community abundance from precipitation patterns at high abundances

- Compiled studies (75) to estimate the relative contribution of biotic selection, gene flow and spatially autocorrelated biotic selection to divergence in traits involved in species interactions
- Biotic selection explained 16% of the variance in trait means for biotic interactions
- Most biotic selection was spatially auto-correlated, thus local adaptation can be operative even under moderate levels of gene flow

- Generated fungal co-occcurrence models using multivariate logistic regression with Bayesian hierarchical statistical methods
- Showed that including habitat veriables altered the magnitude and sign as well as the overall abundance of interactions, although there was very high correlation between the two models (without and with habitat variables)
- Found more + than - co-occurrences, possibly due to negative interactions being seen as positive interactions

- Appropriate use of network analysis depends on choosing the right network representation for the problem at hand
- Standard framework
-- Very restrictive. We must ba able to reduce the system to a set of discrete components whose interactions are strictly dyadic in nature.
-- This reduced structure has facilitated the mathematical and associated scientific applications
-- What factors should be considered when choosing a network representation?
--- 1. When is a node a node?
---- Defining a node needs to be determined by the question of interest and the scale at which that question is relevant
---- Also, determining groups of nodes to aggregate is another possible dimension of this question
--- 2. When is an edge an edge?
---- Direction, weight, variatbility
---- Can a relationship be adequately approximated by a constant function?
---- "More studies that assess the effectiveness of such approximations - and provide concrete, empirically validated guidelines for practice within particular problem domains- would be a welcome addtion to the literature."
--- 3. Time Scales and Network Processes
---- E.g. studies of diffusion dynamics suggest that partnership concurrency is an important predictor of epidemic potential
---- '...edge dynamics (poential and actual data transfers) can be understood only by taking into account the dynamic nature of the set of nodes."

- This is an internal document from SFI by Mark Newman, which looks to be the precursor to his networks textbook.
- Intro: 
-- Originated from Euler's solution of the Konigsberg bridge problem, formailzing as a graph.
-- Questions about single nodes are not relevant in large graphs (hundreds of nodes)
-- "The human eye is an analytic tool of remarkable power, and eyeballing pictures of networks is an excellent 
way to gain an understanding of their structure." 
-- Large graphs for which eyeballing fails must be investigated statistically
-- Goals: 
--- 1) find statstical properties (e.g. path lengths and degree distributions) that characterize the structure and behavior of networked systems
--- 2) create models of networks that can help illucidate the meaning of these properties
--- 3) predict behavior via structural properties and the local rules that govern vertices
-- "Studes of the effects of structure on system behavior on the other hand are still in their infancy."
- Types of Networks
-- digraphs = directed graphs
-- hyperedges = edges taht join more than two vertices
-- n-partite graphs = graphs that can be partitioned into n-distinct types with edges only running between unlike types
-- Other resources: Albert and Barabasi, Dorogovetsev and Mendes, Strogatz
-- Great glossary on page 5
-- Social Networks
-- Information Networks
--- Transfer of information (e.g. citation network, www = website network)
--- Crawls explore the world-wide web's structure
-- Technological Networks
--- power-networks
-- Biological Networks
--- metabolic networks                  
--- protein networks
--- gene regulatory networks (Stewart Kauffman's work)
--- food webs
--- neural networks
--- vascular networks
- Network Properties
-- Random Graphs
--- First studied by Rappaport and Erdos and Renyi
--- Much work here. Many statistical properties have been proved or investigated rigorously
-- Small World Effect
--- Most nodes seem to be connected by a short path
--- Great table of different networks and various statistics pg. 10
-- Transitivity or Clustering
--- Deviation from a random distribution of edges among nodes (i.e. some nodes are more connected than expected from random)
--- The friend of your friend is also likely to be your friend
--- Clustering co-efficient
---- Sometime referred to as network density
-- Degree Distribution
--- Histrogram with the fraction of vertices in the network that have k degree = pk
--- Random = binomial or Poisson in the limit of large graphs
--- Real networks tend to be highly right-skewed with long tails
--- Rarely are there enough measurements to get a good estimate of the tail
---- Solution 1: construct a histogram with bin sizes that increase exponentially with degree and then frequency is divided by the width of the bin to normailze them
---- Solution 2: plot cumulative degree distribution. Does not suffer from the issue of losing the information between points within bins.
--- Exponential distributions and Power law distributions are common and can be investigated using log-log plots using exponential and semi-logarithmic scales, respectively
--- Bipartite graphs have degree distributions for both parts
--- Directed graphs have in and out degree distributions which can be analyzed together as the join distribution
-- Scale Free Networks
--- the functional form of some property(ies) remains unchanged under re-scaling
--- i.e. f(x) remains unchanged in form when x is rescaled
--- Because the solutions to f(ax) = bf(x), the power-law is synonymous with scale-free
--- have some consistent structural properties
-- Maximum Degree
--- k_max = the greatest number of edges any node in the network has
---- The prediction for a random under certain assumptions has been proven
---- Preferential attachment can produce the power-law k_max
-- Network Resilience
--- change in network properties given the removal of edges
--- there are different ways in which vertices can be removed
--- Barabasi's work with the internet is classic
-- Mixing Patterns
--- The association or dissassociation of node types through vertex distribution
--- Food webs show that although there are many links between plants and herbivores and herbivores and carnivores, 
there are few links among herbivores or between carnivores and plants
--- Assortative mixing or homophily
--- Although usually conducted with respect to node properties, this can also be done with vertex properties
-- Degree Correlations
--- Do high degree associate preferentially with other high degree nodes? Or high to low?
-- Community Structure (modules)
--- Groups of nodes with high densities of edges within them, with lower densities between
--- Hierarchical clustering can be done here
-- Network Navigation
--- How connections are perceived also influences the dynamics of networks.
--- For example, Milgram's study showed not only that short links exist but also that individuals are good at finding them.
-- Other network properties
--- Size of the largest component 
--- Betweeness centrality = the number of geodesic paths between other vertices that run through a given vertex 
---- Also Eigen and Laplacian centralities
--- Recurrent motifs (small subgraphs)
*Note there are two sections on the mathematics of network statistics for random (and it's various flavors) and small world graphs.
-- Models of Network Growth
--- Preferential Attachement 
---- Built on the work of Hervert Simaon (1950s) on the "rich get richer" phenomenon
---- Developed by Derek de Solla Price as cumulative advantage (1965) for networks
---- Popularized by Barabasi and Albert 
---- There were three mathematical models of how this occurs
--- Other growth models
--- Vertex copying models
---- In some systems the preferential attachment model doesn't apply (e.g. protein networks)
---- a network grows nodes by copying exisiting nodes (=vertices)
-- Processes Taking Place on Networks
--- E.g. how does the structure of a food-web affect the population dynamics of the species
--- Percolation Theory and Network Resilience
---- A set is determined either occupied or unoccupied through some dynamic process                  
---- E.g. the spread of disease or information
---- Both site (node) and bond (edge) percolation
---- There are several proofs predicting the dynamics of percolation in graphs of different structure
--- Search on Networks
---- Resource is stored in nodes on a network
----- 1. Exhaustive network search: e.g. network crawl
----- 2. Guided network search: crawling is done with some criteria
----- 3. Network navigation: can one design network structures to make a particular search algorithm perform well?
--- Phase Transistions on Networks
---- application of tradiational stastistical mechanical models that show phase transitions
--- Other processes on networks (see Strogatz [387])
---- diffusion processes (e.g. random walks)
---- Discrete dynamical processes (e.g. random Boolean nets of Kauffman)
---- Cellular automata on networks (Watts and Strogatz)
---- Iterated games
---- Weakly coupled oscillators
---- Neural networksn
---- Self-organized critical models 
-- Future Research
--- 1. Develop and organize new and current structural statistics for newtorks "...at present no more than a grab-bag of miscellaneous and largely unrelated tools."
--- 2. Develop more sophisticated models of networks
--- 3. Study and understand the behavior of processes taking place on newtorks

- Examined the effect of network structure (i.e. the pattern of connections to super-generalists).
- Used a dynamic, evolutionary model using a simple trait parameterization.
- Found that the presence of cascades increased the effect of co-evolution and that presence 
of super-generalists decreased the number of changes only in the co-evolutionary structures and
increased the shift in both complimentary and convergence.
